# Exercise 4-1 Pizzas
# Think of atleast 3 types of pizza storer the piza names in a list and use a for loop to print each name
# Modify the loop to print the name in a sentance
# One last line outside the loop as a finishing statement

# Initialize and set the list
pizzas = ['pepperoni', 'stuffed crust', 'thin crust', 'triple cheese', 'meat lovers']

# Start the loop
for pizza in pizzas:
    # Indented to create actions in the loop
    print(f"I really like {pizza} pizza") # print the small sentance with the list item

# Deindent to leave the loop
print("Those are all the pizzas I like!")

# Skipped 4-2 too similar
