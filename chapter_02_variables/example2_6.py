# First File of the Integers Section
# Yet again trying to rush through here 
# Add Subtract and multiples 

# Assign a varible
x = 10
y = 100
z = 5

# Multiple Assignments
a, b, c = 1, 2, 3

# Quick maths

# Addition 
print(x + y)

# Subtraction
print(y - z)

# Multiply
print(a * y)

# Divide
print(y / c) 
# This should be a decimal/float how does python handle this 
# Python doesn't require strict type declaration makes it easier to read

# Power of 
print (b ** c)
print(pow(b, c)) # secondary option

# large numbers = _ to make them more understandale
print(100_10_1000)
# prints 100101000

# Reassign 
x = 15
